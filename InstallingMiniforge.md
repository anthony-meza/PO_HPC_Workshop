`(*)` The Python version is specific only to the base environment. Conda can create new environments with different Python versions and implementations.

`(**)` For Raspberry PI that include a 64 bit processor, you must also use
a 64-bit operating system such as
[Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-64-bit)
or
[Ubuntu for Raspberry PI](https://ubuntu.com/raspberry-pi).
The versions listed as "System: 32-bit" are not compatible with the installers on this website.

`(***)` Apple silicon builds are experimental and haven't had testing like the other platforms.
